description: "Here's another conversion of a well known CTF map. It looks like I'm\
  \ going the good way in the history of CTF4 map building... And converting an existing\
  \ map isn't so hard actually. Duplicating the bases wasn't so hard... I only had\
  \ to remake the entire central area in this map... See of you like it... And feel\
  \ free to send any comments to m_tops@hotmail.com. Of course you need the CTF4 mod\
  \ to play this map. You can download it at www.uncommonplace.com. Have fun!"
