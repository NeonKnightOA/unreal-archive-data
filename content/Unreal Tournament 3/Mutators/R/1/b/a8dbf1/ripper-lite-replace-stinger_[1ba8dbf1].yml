  description: "Liandri's newly-reinstated version of the infamous Ripper. Primary ejects a fast-travelling blade that can slice through bone and muscle, and can pin enemies to surfaces. Secondary fire releases an explosive blade that does less damage, but can send enemies flying through the air, providing a tactical advantage."
