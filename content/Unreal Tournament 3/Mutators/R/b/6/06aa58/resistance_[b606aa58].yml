- name: "N-09 Regulator"
  description: "Necris 9-Core Goliath Hammer \"Regulator\" is a portable implementation\
    \ of Axon Goliath. Using high-density antimatters, it became possible to achieve\
    \ enough impulse to propel the uranium shells, which will explode with matter-antimatter\
    \ cancellation. Furthermore, this neutralizing blast have been found to be able\
    \ to break through Nanoblack-based defenses, such as the Invulnerability Protection\
    \ Device. Soon after its introduction, many combatants inquired of a scope be\
    \ attached to this dead-accurate Goliath Hammer. Later it was nicknamed \"Regulator\"\
    , after the invincibility of highland campers wielding this N-09."
- name: "N-16 Singularity"
  description: "Necris 16-Core Singularity Hammer was originally intended to be equipped\
    \ on a Necris vehicle prototype. While testing their new tech, Phayder Corporation\
    \ found out that the quantum accelerator units were reacting with Nanoblack energy,\
    \ destablizing nearby spacetime continuum. The optimized product with this discovery,\
    \ N-16 Singularity can generate unstable rifts which will be a significant threat\
    \ to the wielder himself and his opponents."
- name: "N-04 Catalyst"
  description: "Necris Quad-Catalyst Hammer is an implementation of ASMD Tech. This\
    \ Hammer spits out catalyst projectiles at a rate of 240/min. Upon contact with\
    \ any surface or flesh, the projectiles then will emit high-voltage catalyst currents\
    \ which will rip anything apart."
- name: "N-02 Diffusion Shock Rifle"
  description: "Diffusion Shock Rifle is a modification of the stock weapon, to an\
    \ edge in tournament competition. Each discharge of this weapon stuns your opponents\
    \ for a second, enough for both offensive and defensive purposes. Additionally,\
    \ Necris tech have enabled the ASMD core of this weapon to boost by three different\
    \ condense levels: 1, 4, 16. Level.4 Core deals 4 times more damage, which is\
    \ suitable for instant gibbing after knocking your opponents down with Level.1\
    \ Core. The highest condense level is Level.16."
- name: "N-42 Infinity"
  description: "Infinity, the last superweapon you'll ever need, grants you the power\
    \ to remove your opponents from competition. After stocking this weapon with full\
    \ ammo, press AltFire to WIN."
