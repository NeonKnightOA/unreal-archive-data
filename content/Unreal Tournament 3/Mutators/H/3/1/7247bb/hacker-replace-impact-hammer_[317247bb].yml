  description: "Designed as a reinstatement of a blade-based melee weapon for the\
    \ Tournament, the Liandri Hacker is a durable tarydium-powered mining tool that\
    \ can cut through tough materials with little to no resistance, including flesh.\
    \ Primary fire initialises the high-speed circular saw, whereas secondary fire\
    \ engages the rubble-clearing electrical discharge, which is powerful enough to\
    \ launch vehicles around and destroy them in two or three hits."
