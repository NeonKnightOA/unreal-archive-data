description: "I used to play UT2004 a lot and I remembered a map called DM-1on1-Lea.\
  \  I remembered playing it in a tourney against Perfection.  (I lost in overtime).\
  \  Anywho, this map seemed like it would be a great duel for for UT3.  I decided\
  \ to waste over 100 hours making this map so that only I and a few other people\
  \ can enjoy it because UT3 is such a dead game.  Holy crap I'm depressing myself.\
  \  Seriously though, even if you don't like UT3 yet it's installed or you have it,\
  \ check out this map.  It's pretty cool.  Unfortunately, you will need the Titan\
  \ Pack because I used some textures / meshes from the Titan Pack.  If you don't\
  \ have the Titan Pack, then you're probably not using UT3 to play it online.  This\
  \ is my first map for UT3.  Technically, it's my first completed map ever.  I've\
  \ made attempts when I played UT2004, but I never actually finished a map, let alone\
  \ a layout.  This map is the culmination of my efforts in the past and I think it\
  \ shows.  I put a lot of time and effort into optimizing the map for good performance\
  \ (framerate, lag, etc). If you turn your graphics all the way up, your framerate\
  \ should barely suffer.  If you turn your graphics all the way down (specifically\
  \ detail mode), the map will become like a low poly holp map. A lot of the machinery,\
  \ pipes, 3D trims and vegetation which are pretty much non essential have been removed\
  \ for low quality detail mode.  This ensures that the map has great performance\
  \ but still looks good since I've put a lot of effort into it."
