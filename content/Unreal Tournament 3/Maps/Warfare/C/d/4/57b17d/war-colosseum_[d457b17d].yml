description: "A large sized Warfare Map at a Mediterranean island. The center node\
  \ is placed in the middle of a slightly modified replica of the Colosseum in Rome.\
  \ The Power Cores are based in two square seized temples ( they have the same seize\
  \ as the Panthenon of the Acropolis in Athens ). The two prime nodes are placed\
  \ in two circular temples ( they have the same seize as the Tholos of the Oracle\
  \ of Delphi ) !"
