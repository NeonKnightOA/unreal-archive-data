description: "This island paradise is sucking the life out of me. Fighting on the\
  \ beaches of this island saps my strength and diminishes my will to fight and survive.\
  \ I lost a good friend down near the trench on the beach today, Ill miss him a lot.\
  \  He wont go on to fight another day.  With all this fighting and with no end in\
  \ sight, makes me wonder if it is all worth it.  Im picking myself back up off the\
  \ beach again.  I can feel the blood and sweat pouring off my brow.  This sand wedged\
  \ between my teeth sure leaves a bitter taste in my mouth."
