description: "Long ago the battlefield known as Severance was abandoned and humans\
  \ started to settle in the unused killing fields.  That is until a strange mysterious\
  \ liquid was found.  The Landri Corporation set up operations to harvest the liquid\
  \ which are overseen by the Sentinels.  Be careful not to disrupt the harvesting\
  \ process lest you disturb the Sentinels.  They are watching you."
