description: "Station E220602, forward assault and supply station for Liandri fleets\
  \ in the vector quadrant. Originally its purpose was to fuel supply lines in the\
  \ continual war against the Necris and Krall. Shortly after the partially constructed\
  \ station went online a surprise attack by the Krall has left it decimated and in\
  \ pieces. Scavengers from the nearby planet have landed on the remaining hulk of\
  \ the station scrambling to grab any remaining fuel and munitions before the Krall,\
  \ or the Necris, return to finish the station for good. Unfortunately for them the\
  \ Liandri have decided to use the station as a testing ground for their new Titan\
  \ technology...."
