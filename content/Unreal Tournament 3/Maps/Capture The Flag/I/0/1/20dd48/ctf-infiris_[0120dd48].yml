description: "Only 5 years ago this was a lovely, tropical paradise called Edenia.\
  \ A huge meteor then crashed into this planet, fragmenting it's crust and covering\
  \ the planet with a huge magma tidal wave. It is now referred to as 'Infiris' by\
  \ tournament fighters after the latin 'Inferis' meaning Hell."
