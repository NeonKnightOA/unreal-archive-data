description: "The Liandri may have lost their foothold in sector 38 many cycles ago\
  \ but evidence of their occupation still haunts the sector. Another decimated defence\
  \ platform endlessly orbits its parent planet waiting for its eventual demise from\
  \ the local asteroid population which continuously bombards the remaining debris\
  \ of this platform which once defended the parent planets population."
