description: "The Liandri Corporation discovered an old abandoned factory that was\
  \ used to train and prepare humans to defend Earth from invasion.  Most of the machinery\
  \ has been removed to make room for the numerous soldiers who served bravely in\
  \ war.  As the tournament resumes it's post-war schedule, these walls will again\
  \ absorb the sweat of the numerous recruits who will once again train, now for their\
  \ own victory and glory."
