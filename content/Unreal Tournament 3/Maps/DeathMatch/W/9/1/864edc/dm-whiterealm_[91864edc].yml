description: "Ice, snow, cold, hear me out - strike down the defilers who hath come\
  \ to our temple to test their strenght. Freeze the mighty oceans, unleash the furiuos\
  \ wind, tremble the ground, send interlopers to back their gods, back to the sky\
  \ from where they came. Make our kingdom beautiful once more, cover the mountains\
  \ with snow. Oh, Lord of Storms, unleash your migth upon invaders for they are defiling\
  \ our monuments to fulfill their hunger for annihilation. Freeze, suffocate, destroy\
  \ them, make the White Realm beautiful once more..."
