description: "Small atmospheric map set in a building constructed out of lots of wood\
  \ and metal. If you have problems with performance type \"ce performance\" in console.\
  \ Creation of this map was started in June 2009, but month or two moths later was\
  \ frozen for more than one year. In October 2010 we'd returned with more experience\
  \ and higher skill to finish what we'd begun."
