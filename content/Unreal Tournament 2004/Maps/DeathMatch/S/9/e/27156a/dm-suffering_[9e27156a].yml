description: "One of the main facilities constructed in the early 21st century to\
  \ harness the searing heat and energy of magma, this deathmatch arena offers intense\
  \ heat, but fortunately for the competitors, there is little chance to taste it.\
  \ Environmental hazards are kept at a minimum via lava covering walkways and grating\
  \ systems, leaving the competition solely between the competitors in a super-heated\
  \ environment."
