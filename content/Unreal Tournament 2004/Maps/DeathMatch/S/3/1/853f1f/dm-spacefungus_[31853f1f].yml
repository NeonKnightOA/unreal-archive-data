description: "Building Star Bases on alien planets  can be hazardous. But when the\
  \ crew discovered that fungus was slowly getting into the station and started filling\
  \ up the corridors, especially after personnel started going  missing, it was time\
  \ to abandon the base. It was also time for Liandri to move in and make a great\
  \ arena.A tight but fast small tournament with claustrophobic feel. Tricky corners\
  \ and hungry fungus make this map fun. Good for one on one but can accommodate up\
  \ to 6 comfortably."
