description: "A while back, the world felt the need for tighter security, to crack\
  \ down on crime across the world. So a facility was designed to keep an eye on things,\
  \ from the air. They were decommisioned however, flaws were found in their safety\
  \ regulations and people would often be falling to their very deaths. The last station\
  \ left standing was sold to the tournaments. During the weeks that followed, the\
  \ military had under construction a new facility much like the first, used to assault\
  \ ground bases with heavy force and speed. With nothing left but a field test, the\
  \ model was handed to the most bloodthirsty show on the planet, whith a few viewer\
  \ recommended attachments of course..."
