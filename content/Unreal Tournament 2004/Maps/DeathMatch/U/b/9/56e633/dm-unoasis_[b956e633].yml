description: "Deep within the deserts of lower Egypt, a massive sandstorm has swept\
  \ across the lands, stirring up dust in a way nobody had ever seen before. Now,\
  \ eight thousand years after being buried, many priceless artifacts and temples\
  \ are surfacing. Liandri seems to have found a treasure of its own."
