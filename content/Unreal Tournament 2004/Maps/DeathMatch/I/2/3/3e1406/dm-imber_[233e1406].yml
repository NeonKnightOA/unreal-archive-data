description: "Millenia of rain has worn this serene temple, once a sacred place of\
  \ meditation for its long lost builders, to a soaked and overgrown ruin. Now its\
  \ South American rain-forest home has been uncovered by Liandri, torches have been\
  \ relit, weapons placed; there's Death Match to be played."
