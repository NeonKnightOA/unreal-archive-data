description: "While conducting one of their numerous experiments, Izanagi scientists\
  \ discovered a 'pocket' black hole.  Eventually they found a way to travel to the\
  \ center of the pocket and return.   When announced to the public, Liandri made\
  \ a very generous donation to the Izanagi research fund, and in return, Izanagi\
  \ scientists gave permission to hold tournaments within it."
