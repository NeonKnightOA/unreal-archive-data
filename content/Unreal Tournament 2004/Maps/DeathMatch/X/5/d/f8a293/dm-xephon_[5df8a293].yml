description: "Abandoned during the Earth year 1884, these ruins were reconstructed\
  \ and reinvented as an arena for the Tournaments. Unlike most arenas this particular\
  \ one was not founded by Liandri, but rather by a renegade group of clan members\
  \ who were disqualified from the very first Unreal Tournament. After years of illegal\
  \ underground fighting, Liandri discovered the arena and has now accepted it into\
  \ it's regular Deathmatch rotation."
