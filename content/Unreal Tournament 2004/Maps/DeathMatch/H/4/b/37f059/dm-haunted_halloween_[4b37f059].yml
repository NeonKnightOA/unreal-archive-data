description: "Beware of things that go bump in the night, and keep to small. It was\
  \ a saying back in the days, when people actually lived in this abandoned house.\
  \ There were to be some renovations done here. Somehow everyone ended up dead. Now\
  \ the word is out, noone wants to live here. It is the perfect background for the\
  \ dark season's tournament. Also be warned about the creepy crawling corners of\
  \ the house, you might regret it."
