description: "The Metus refinery was known to its workers as being the most desolate,\
  \ bleak, and soulless environment imaginable. Located on a small island in the middle\
  \ of the vast ocean, there was no communication with the outside world. Workers\
  \ would spend their entire lives there, often going insane from the incessant hum\
  \ of rusty machinery. There remain now only two workers, and one emergency escape\
  \ pod. Only a fight to the death will determine who will be free from the torture\
  \ of Metus.| |The floors have been swept of bones and blood. The machinery has been\
  \ cleared. The weapons have been unpacked. Fight for your escape."
