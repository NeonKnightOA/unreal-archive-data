description: "The Legendary MCS UnderGround is back!!The First version i made for\
  \ 2k4 was way to big considering the size it had for ut99 and just the way it played.did'nt\
  \ get the same feeling playing it in 2k4.Now like it's counterpart this version\
  \ is better suited for both lowgravity or regular gravity game play.Onlike the ut99\
  \ version with an industrial look, this one was made with an egyptian style layout....Enjoy!!!"
