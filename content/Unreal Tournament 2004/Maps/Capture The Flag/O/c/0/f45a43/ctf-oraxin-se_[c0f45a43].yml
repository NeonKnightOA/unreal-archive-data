description: "The Oraxin installation was once a sprawling complex used by now defunct\
  \ industrial behemoths for the development, testing, and production of high explsoives.\
  \ The facility is being slowly dismantled, but in the meantime, the battle rages\
  \ on, and more blood stains the already tainted walls where explosives were already\
  \ tested. || this is a rework of my third map, done to increase overall quality\
  \ since I wasn't quite happy with the map, and to fix the notorios HOM in the red\
  \ base. Rocking music is by Zynthetic. Enjoy it! -CyMek"
