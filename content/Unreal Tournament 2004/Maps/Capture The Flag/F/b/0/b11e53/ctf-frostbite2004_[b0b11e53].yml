description: "Frostbite Canyon was originally a cold weather military training outpost.\
  \ It has since been abandoned and acquired by Liandri Corporation. Modified for\
  \ competition it quickly became the most revered venue in the sector. Rumors of\
  \ a supernatural presence, the bitter cold environment, earthquakes, and dangerous\
  \ inhabitants have kept all but the most intrepid competitors away."
