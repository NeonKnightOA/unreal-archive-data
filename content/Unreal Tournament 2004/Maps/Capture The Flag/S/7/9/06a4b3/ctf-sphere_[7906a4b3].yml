description: "For the Unreal Tournament the most extreme battlegrounds are appointed.\
  \ Therefore the legendary deep-sea facility Sphere was chosen, with its strange\
  \ gravity and curious environments. Sharks often circle it, enticed by the light\
  \ and combatants fighting it out on the other side of the glass walls."
