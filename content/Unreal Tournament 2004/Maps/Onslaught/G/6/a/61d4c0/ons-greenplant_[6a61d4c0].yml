description: "After war with the Skaarj not only the cities were destroyed, but also\
  \ large areas of the world's nature. So the humans constructed big domes to rebuilt\
  \ them. Now the woods are back, but the domes still exist. The Liandri Corporation\
  \ thinks this is the best place to test the new Tournament Vehicles."
