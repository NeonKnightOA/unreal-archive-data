description: "Centuries ago the Stormy Mountains were a Nali fortress which has been\
  \ making a stand agains Skaarj invaders. The attackers were unable to breach the\
  \ Nalis' powerful defences, and created a heavy thunderstorm in the area in order\
  \ to soften up the defending force before another assault attempt. After the storm\
  \ raged for a few weeks, the Nali were forced to retreat, and the Skaarj could continue\
  \ their conquest. The rain has now washed away all memory of that ancient war, and\
  \ Liandri Corporation has now turned this area into another arena for Onslaught."
