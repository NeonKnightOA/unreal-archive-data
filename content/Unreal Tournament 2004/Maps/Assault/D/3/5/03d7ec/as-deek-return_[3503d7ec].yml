description: "The tide turned in the final battle with the Renegades. However the\
  \ cost in pilots was great, and the Earth Federation was forced to pull what little\
  \ resources they had left, to keep the space navy intact. During that engagement,\
  \ the final death scream of the reevers was broadcasted over all communications.\
  \ But, not all of that signal was a scream, burried deep within was a code. For\
  \ years it remained dormant, until the memory of the Renegade Wars, was all but\
  \ a bad dream. This code had a purpose, this time the Ancient programming was willing\
  \ to wait, wait until it was all but forgotten, and then, to slowely take over the\
  \ enemy one by one, without giving itself away......Soon, the space navy turning\
  \ on the Earth Federation, the ancient program sensed success...All major systems\
  \ had been taken over, except one. The sole Reever that survived the Wars, the Reever\
  \ had been stripped of all programming. Once reprogrammed, the elite of the Earth\
  \ Federation pursued the navy ships, singled them out and engaged. Around the fringes\
  \ of Saturn, the Reever attached the first Starship Singleton. This was to be the\
  \ Reevers testing ground."
