description: "The tournament owners have purchased a run down section of the city\
  \ and sectioned off a few alleys and buildings.  Teams now must take to the streets\
  \ and dark alleys to battle for the flags.  Mutiple routes to and from the flags\
  \ exist. Flag runners can use vehicles to storm down the main alley or can use side\
  \ streets and roof tops to make their plays for the flag. Special thanks to Toonces\
  \ for letting me use some of his textures and meshes from CarParkRoadRage][.  Thanks\
  \ to Coke-Man and to TherMight for play testing and advice on level design.|\epRembo\
