description: "In 2352, an anomalous volcanic eruption on the outskirts of Jerusalem\
  \ partially unearthed a city far below the lost city of Ekron. Four years of intensive\
  \ excavation revealed a civilization that predated all known human history. Purchased\
  \ by Liandri corporation for the price of excavation, the souls of arena combatants\
  \ now join the forgotten dead of the unremembered past."
