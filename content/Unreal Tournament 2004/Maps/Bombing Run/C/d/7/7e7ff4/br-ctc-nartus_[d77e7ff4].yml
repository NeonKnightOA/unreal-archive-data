description: "On the farthest reaches of the Gerlnym Belt lies a planet that was populated\
  \ by an ancient Druidic people. Their time long past, the Temple Nartus at Ampoulous\
  \ is all that remains as testament of their glory and power. It is said that amongst\
  \ the crashes of lightning, the voices of the priests can still be heard echoing\
  \ their long silenced chants."
