weapons:
- name: "Lightning Gun"
  description: "The Lightning Gun is a high-power energy rifle capable of ablating\
    \ even the heaviest carapace armor. Acquisition of a target at long range requires\
    \ a steady hand, but the anti-jitter effect of the optical system reduces the\
    \ weapon's learning curve significantly. Once the target has been acquired, the\
    \ operator depresses the trigger, painting a proton 'patch' on the target. Milliseconds\
    \ later the rifle emits a high voltage arc of electricity, which seeks out the\
    \ charge differential and annihilates the target."
- name: "Shock Rifle"
  description: "The ASMD Shock Rifle has changed little since its incorporation into\
    \ the Tournaments. The ASMD sports two firing modes capable of acting in concert\
    \ to neutralize opponents in a devastating shockwave.||This combination attack\
    \ is achieved when the weapon operator utilizes the secondary fire mode to deliver\
    \ a charge of seeded plasma to the target.|Once the slow-moving plasma charge\
    \ is within range of the target, the weapon operator may fire the photon beam\
    \ into the plasma core, releasing the explosive energy of the anti-photons contained\
    \ within the plasma's EM field."
- name: "Rocket Launcher"
  description: "The Trident Tri-barrel Rocket Launcher is extremely popular among\
    \ competitors who enjoy more bang for their buck.|The rotating rear loading barrel\
    \ design allows for both single- and multi-warhead launches, letting you place\
    \ up to three dumb fire rockets on target.|The warheads are designed to deliver\
    \ maximum concussive force to the target and surrounding area upon detonation."
- name: "Minigun"
  description: "The Schultz-Metzger T23-A 23mm rotary cannon is capable of firing\
    \ both high-velocity caseless ammunition and cased rounds. With an unloaded weight\
    \ of only 8 kilograms, the T23 is portable and maneuverable, easily worn across\
    \ the back when employing the optional carrying strap.|The T23-A is the rotary\
    \ cannon of choice for the discerning soldier."
- name: "MatrixWeapon"
  description: "MatrixWeapon"
- name: "Link Gun"
  description: "Riordan Dynamic Weapon Systems combines the best of weapon design\
    \ in the Advanced Plasma Rifle v23, commonly known as the Link Gun.|While the\
    \ primary firing mode of the Link remains the same as its plasma-firing predecessor,\
    \ the secondary cutting torch has been replaced with a switchable energy matrix.\
    \ Upon contacting a teammate, it converts to a harmless carrier stream, offloading\
    \ energy from the onboard cells to boost the output of any targeted player also\
    \ using the Link.|It should be noted that while players are boosting a teammate,\
    \ they are unable to defend themselves from attack."
- name: "Flak Cannon"
  description: "Trident Defensive Technologies Series 7 Flechette Cannon has been\
    \ taken to the next step in evolution with the production of the Mk3 "
- name: "Sniper Rifle"
  description: "This high muzzle velocity sniper rifle with a 10X scope is a lethal\
    \ weapon at any range, especially if you can land a head shot."
- name: "Bio-Rifle"
  description: "The GES BioRifle continues to be one of the most controversial weapons\
    \ in the Tournament. Loved by some, loathed by others, the BioRifle has long been\
    \ the subject of debate over its usefulness.||Some Tournament purists argue that\
    \ it is the equivalent of a cowardly minefield. Others argue that it enhances\
    \ the tactical capabilities of defensive combatants.|Despite the debate, the weapon\
    \ provides rapid-fire wide-area coverage in primary firing mode, and a single-fire\
    \ variable payload secondary firing mode. In layman's terms, this equates to being\
    \ able to pepper an area with small globs of Biosludge, or launch one large glob\
    \ at the target."
- name: "Assault Rifle"
  description: "Inexpensive and easily produced, the AR770 provides a lightweight\
    \ 5.56mm combat solution that is most effective against unarmored foes. With low-to-moderate\
    \ armor penetration capabilities, this rifle is best suited to a role as a light\
    \ support weapon.|The optional M355 Grenade Launcher provides the punch that makes\
    \ this weapon effective against heavily armored enemies.  Pick up a second assault\
    \ rifle to double your fire power."
