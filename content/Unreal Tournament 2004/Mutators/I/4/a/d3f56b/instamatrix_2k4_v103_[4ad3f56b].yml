weapons:
- name: "IM-Assault Rifle"
  description: "Inexpensive and easily produced, the AR770 provides a lightweight\
    \ 5.56mm combat solution that is most effective against unarmored foes. With low-to-moderate\
    \ armor penetration capabilities, this rifle is best suited to a role as a light\
    \ support weapon.|The optional M355 Grenade Launcher provides the punch that makes\
    \ this weapon effective against heavily armored enemies.  Pick up a second assault\
    \ rifle to double your fire power."

  description: "IM-Flak Cannon"
- name: "IM-Link Gun"
  description: "Riordan Dynamic Weapon Systems combines the best of weapon design\
    \ in the Advanced Plasma Rifle v23, commonly known as the Link Gun.|While the\
    \ primary firing mode of the Link remains the same as its plasma-firing predecessor,\
    \ the secondary cutting torch has been replaced with a switchable energy matrix.\
    \ Upon contacting a teammate, it converts to a harmless carrier stream, offloading\
    \ energy from the onboard cells to boost the output of any targeted player also\
    \ using the Link.|It should be noted that while players are boosting a teammate,\
    \ they are unable to defend themselves from attack."
- name: "IM-Minigun"
  description: "The Schultz-Metzger T23-A 23mm rotary cannon is capable of firing\
    \ both high-velocity caseless ammunition and cased rounds. With an unloaded weight\
    \ of only 8 kilograms, the T23 is portable and maneuverable, easily worn across\
    \ the back when employing the optional carrying strap.|The T23-A is the rotary\
    \ cannon of choice for the discerning soldier."
- name: "IM-Rocket Launcher"
  description: "IM-Rocket Launcher"
- name: "IM-Shield Gun"
  description: "The Kemphler DD280 Riot Control Device has the ability to resist and\
    \ reflect incoming projectiles and energy beams. The plasma wave inflicts massive\
    \ damage, rupturing tissue, pulverizing organs, and flooding the bloodstream with\
    \ dangerous gas bubbles.||This weapon may be intended for combat at close range,\
    \ but when wielded properly should be considered as dangerous as any other armament\
    \ in your arsenal."
- name: "IM-Shock Rifle"
  description: "The ASMD Shock Rifle has changed little since its incorporation into\
    \ the Tournaments. The ASMD sports two firing modes capable of acting in concert\
    \ to neutralize opponents in a devastating shockwave.||This combination attack\
    \ is achieved when the weapon operator utilizes the secondary fire mode to deliver\
    \ a charge of seeded plasma to the target.|Once the slow-moving plasma charge\
    \ is within range of the target, the weapon operator may fire the photon beam\
    \ into the plasma core, releasing the explosive energy of the anti-photons contained\
    \ within the plasma's EM field."

- name: "IM-TransLocator"
  description: "IM Translocator"
- name: "IM-Sniper Rifle"
  description: "This high muzzle velocity sniper rifle with a 10X scope is a lethal\
    \ weapon at any range, especially if you can land a head shot."
- name: "IM-Mine Layer"
  description: "The Spider Mine Layer is used for deploying spider mines, autonomous\
    \ mobile mines that are highly effective against both foot soldiers and vehicles."
