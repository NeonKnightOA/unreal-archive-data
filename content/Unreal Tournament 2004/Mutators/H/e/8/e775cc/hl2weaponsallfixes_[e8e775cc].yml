weapons:
- name: "Crossbow"
  description: "The new crossbow is a sniper's dream. It fires a piece of heated rebar\
    \ over a long distance, and can be used to pin people to wall. It is a one shot\
    \ one kill weapon against all but the toughest enemies."
- name: "Crowbar"
  description: "The same old weapon we know and love from the first game. Use it to\
    \ play whack-a-mole with headcrabs, scanners and manhacks."
- name: "Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator"
  description: "The greatest weapon ever made. The gravity gun can be used to interact\
    \ with almost every non-organic object in the game. It turns barrels and propane\
    \ tanks into bludgeons of death, and makes retrieving weapons, health and ammunition\
    \ child's play."
- name: "Combine Assault Rifle"
  description: "Using the omnipresent Combine pulse technology, the Combine Assault\
    \ Rifle does devastating amounts of damage quickly, at the expense of ammunition\
    \ at a high rate. The alternate fire shoots a plasma ball that bounces around\
    \ like a giant rubber ball, killing anything it touches outright (with the exception\
    \ of some of the larger foes)."
- name: ".357 Magnum"
  description: "Similar to the original .357 from half-life, this one does not have\
    \ a zoom function. It also doesnt carry as much ammunition. However, it packs\
    \ a massive punch, and you will forget about any shortcomings the first time you\
    \ see a Combine flip from a headshot."
- name: "Modified Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator"
  description: "The greatest weapon ever made. The gravity gun can be used to interact\
    \ with almost every non-organic object in the game. It turns barrels and propane\
    \ tanks into bludgeons of death, and makes retrieving weapons, health and ammunition\
    \ child's play."
- name: "USP Match"
  description: "Simply a standard side arm, the pistol is great for taking out headcrabs\
    \ and setting explosive barrels on fire. It is also a godsend after you have run\
    \ around with nothing but a crowbar and foul language."
- name: "RPG Launcher"
  description: "Still the best tool around for taking out flying targets. The HL2\
    \ version lacks the alternate fire that turns off the targeting laser, but who\
    \ used that mode anyway?"
- name: "Sub-Machine Gun MP-7"
  description: "The MP7 is a respectable little submachine gun with a high rate of\
    \ fire but fairly low level of damage. To make up for that it also has a grenade\
    \ launcher alternate fire that can be very useful in tight situations."
- name: "SPAS-12"
  description: "Essentially the same beast as HL1, with both single and double fire.\
    \ It is a powerful, effective weapon at close range, great for taking out zombies\
    \ and antlions. The one main difference between it and its predecessor is that\
    \ it only holds 6 shells, so conserve your ammo!"
