## About UTPG

> UTPG are a group of programmers and server admins from the UT community who 
> got together and approached Epic about the possibility of maintaining the 
> Unreal Tournament code base. Since their goal of maintaining the game and 
> fixing obvious problems, while keeping all the major game-play systems 100% 
> intact, were right along with Epic's goals, Epic granted them access to the 
> source which allowed them to undertake this project. UTPGs focus is general 
> maintenance with some time spent dealing with security issues in the Unreal
> Tournament engine.
>
> Special thanks to Epic and specifically Joe (Dr. Sin) and Ryan (Linux guru) 
> for the support and assistance they gave to this project.

  ```
  get Engine.GameInfo IPPolicies #
  ```
  Where `#` is the number starting from 0, if you omit the number the first element is returned
  ```
	set Engine.GameInfo IPPolicies # new value
  ```
