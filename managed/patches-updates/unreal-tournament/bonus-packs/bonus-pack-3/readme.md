## Bonus Pack 3 (Inoxx Pack)

> NOTE: If you installed the game from Steam, you should already have this content.

### New Levels

#### CTF-Face][ (4-12 players)

The sequel to Facing Worlds, the original Unreal Tournament Capture the Flag Map. This new version is quite a bit more intense, as the bases
are 20% closer and there are more sniping spots.

#### CTF-High (8-16 players)

This is a large, wide open CTF map that requires a good PC in order to run well with a lot of players. Try to avoid falling to the streets
below!

#### CTF-Nucleus (6-12 players)

A much tighter Capture the Flag map that takes place in an old power station. Careful when you navigate the lower passageway, as the
switches in the map will cause the tunnels to electrify!

#### CTF-Kosov (10-16 players)

Enormous Capture the Flag map. This map requires a minimum of ten players in order to play really well. Skilled players will make use of the
canyon walls as defense points and alternate routes to and from the flag bases.

#### DM-Crane (8-16 players)

Sprawling construction site arena that requires a lot of players. Beware of campers on the two cranes on either side of the map!

#### DM-SpaceNoxx (2-6 players)

In the tradition of Morpheus comes the next wave of cool Low Gravity arena maps! Dodging will let you zip around this map quickly; be
careful to not fall into the blue plasma in the center of the structure!
