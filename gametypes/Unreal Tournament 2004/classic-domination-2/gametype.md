The original Domination game type from the (UT99) Unreal Tournament: Game of The
Year edition is back for Unreal Tournament 2004.  This is the real Domination game
type, everything is the same as the original, down to the unlimited use of the
translocator!  Also included is the new game type of Vehicle Domination.  
Domination with the use of Vehicles!

This upgrade of Classic Domination includes new support for Double Domination maps,
by default list Classic Domination internet servers in the Double Domination
servers list. Fixed the bugs and yields better performance then the prior version
of Classic Domination.  The BotAI has had a major overhaul.
