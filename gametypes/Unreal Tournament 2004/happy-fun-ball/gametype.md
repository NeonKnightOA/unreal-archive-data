Happy Fun Ball is easy to play. The goal is to knock the ball (by shooting it) into an opponent's goal. There are two ways to accomplish
this - 

1) to shoot the ball, aiming it where you want it to go, and 
2) providing cover for your teammates who are trying to accomplish #1.

The Happy Fun Balls are Karma spheres, which means they spin, bounce, and roll according to accurate physics. Players caught in the way of
the ball can be tossed aside or even crushed.
