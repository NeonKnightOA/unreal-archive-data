## What is ROCKETEER?

ROCKETEER is a mod for Unreal Tournament 2004 implementing Rocket Arena's gameplay.
Rocket Arena was originally written by crt for Quake2/3, and then by Mongo for Unreal Tournament.

For those of you already familiar with ROCKETEER, this new version has been augmented with multi-arena support, team line, revised
rocketjumping, link climbing, "native" brightskins support and a voting/admin system.

## Gameplay

ROCKETEER is a round-based team/1on1 game where all players spawn with the same inventory:

- health
- armor
- weapons

The inventory is votable and several presets exist for having RA:UT1 gameplay, ROCKETEER gameplay, etc.
Maps don't have any pickups since the players already have at spawn everything they'd need during play.
There is no self-damage nor team damage.

As in most round-based games, when a player dies, he won't respawn until next round. A round ends when everyone of the teams has been
eliminated. When a team has won a set number of rounds, this team wins the game, and the next game can start: the losing team is put back at
the end of the line and the winning team plays with the team at the head of the line.

## Multi-arena maps

ROCKETEER maps are subdivided into several so-called arenas, and each arena has its own game running. At any point in time, players can join
and leave arenas within the map being played by the server without having to disconnect and reconnect.

## Non-Multi-arena maps

ROCKETEER also supports standard (non-multi-arena) maps (i.e. DM-Antalus, DM-Campgrounds, etc.)
