## QUICK OVERVIEW:

Old Skool Monsta Toolz (OSMT) is a mod/add-on for UT2004 that is designed to reintroduce the complex old skool Unreal monster AI and it's
related actors for use in any gametype. These tools mimic the original Unreal actors and settings so that "old timers" can easily pick it up
and "newcomers" have lots of online reference documentation already available.

The toolset also includes a new gametype, OSM Adventure (OSM), which makes use of all classes in the toolset to facilitate story-driven
adventures through progressive Objectives comprised of puzzles, traps and monsters.

## PROJECT AIM:

The project's aim is to allow the vast community of UT2004 mappers to create maps that take advantage of this well-designed AI scheme in any
gametype, especially in story-driven SinglePlayer and CoOperative adventures. This even allows aspiring game designers to easily develop
whole game prototypes within the UT2004 framework, by providing a foundation of code to expand upon which frees them to concentrate on
gameplay and art assets.

## WHAT DOES IT DO?:

For mappers of UT2004, this is a set of tools that you can use to implement very complex monster/NPC behavior in any gametype. For players,
OSMT is a small download that allows you to play a wide variety of maps in any gametype that include monsters/NPCs with advanced AI. OSMT
also includes a new Single Player / CoOperative gametype, OSM Adventure (OSM), with progressive objectives conquering puzzles, traps and
monsters. OSM Adventure maps, are primarily story-driven adventures that range from sci-fi to fantasy to purely arcade, however completely
different kinds of games, such as driving games, platformers, mysteries, etc., can be made with OSM Adventure as a base.
