## What is Project Torlan and HaloUT?

Project Torlan is a full-scale Total Conversion mod aimed at porting HaloPC into the Unreal Tournament 2004 engine. This port will be known
as "HaloUT".

## How much are you going to convert?

We are going to convert as much content from the original Halo as we possibly can. Maps, Vehicles, Weapons, Characters, everything.

## Why are you doing this?

For a number of reasons. First and foremost, we believe (and we're not pointing any fingers) that HaloPC was not as good a port of the
original Xbox title as it could've been. Unreal's engine provides vastly superior graphics performance, visual quality, gameplay variety,
modding capabilities, and most importantly, better net code. We believe that the same classic Halo played in the Unreal engine will make for
a better experience overall. And so far, this has proven true.

## Is this legal?

We don't really know for certain, as to our knowledge this is the first case of such a mod project. We have sent emails to both Bungie and
Gearbox with no reply, but we feel it is safe to proceed based on reading the EULA for HaloPC.
