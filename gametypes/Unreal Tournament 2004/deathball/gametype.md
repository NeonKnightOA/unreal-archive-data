## What is DeathBall

DeathBall is a top class "First Person Sport Game" that combines elements of Football/Soccer, Rugby and Handball.
It's currently a mod for UT2004, but it has nothing to do with a shooter and is a pure sports game.

### 2 Teams, 2 Goals, 1 Ball

In order to score, you need to shoot the ball into the opponent goal.

It's being played with about 5 players on each team, all controled by humans. Everybody plays his role on the team. Goal keeper, defender, attacker or whatever the team comes up with.

You have total control over what you do and you can no longer complain about the bad aiming of your PES or FIFA players.

Hard shots, complex volleys with frontspin, banana passes, it's all up to you.

At first it seems to be pretty simple, but the more you play it the more you realize how complex the gameplay is and how many possibilities your team has. The ways to score are infinite.
