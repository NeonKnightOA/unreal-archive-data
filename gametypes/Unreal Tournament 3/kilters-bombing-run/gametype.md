### Bombing Run (2k4-style) for Unreal Tournament 3

KilterBR is just what I’m calling my version of Bombing Run for UT3. Unlike the already existing Bombing Run mod by Warhead, this one is
much more faithful to the 2k4 version. All your favorites are still there, the goals, the ball, and even the ball launcher.

While we are using the 2k4 meshes, etc. at present, over time I’d like to get skins/meshes that blend in with the UT3 look more. I figured
let’s start with the things we know and we’ll evolve them over time. I have the 3ds Max, I just need the time… and the talent :-P
