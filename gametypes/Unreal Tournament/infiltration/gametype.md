## What is Infiltration?

Infiltration is an immersion into realism, driven by intense military combat, in a squad-based, mission-oriented shooter. Each of those
missions brings the distinctive taste of multifaceted warfare in any environment you can imagine.

You will choose your gear prior to the mission, based on the kind of soldier you want to be. Decide from a cache of modern-day weapons,
keeping in mind the size and weight of the equipment and how much you can carry. Each mission will allow you to become a unique soldier,
based on the equipment and skill you contribute to the tasks at hand.

The different venues you will be called into won't have weapons and ammunition lying about. You must bring in what you can carry, and
salvage what you need from comrades or the enemy.

We give you the tools to do the job. How you do it is up to you. Take the skills you learn in one battle to help you with future missions
and objectives. If you become a talented sniper, it's because you develop the skill to use the weapon and tactics properly and effectively.

Keep in mind that these bullets are for real. One well placed shot, and you are out! Use common sense, pay attention to detail, and watch
your buddy's back. The essence of teamwork separates the winners from the dead.

Take your missions seriously, and move with diligence. Running around aimlessly will only put your team, and the entire mission, at risk.
Play it smart, and you might come out of this alive.

  eye to aim through the weapons iron sights or scope.
