### Story

Mankind's exodus from the ravaged Earth has been violently cut short by the collective
alien military from a neighboring solar system. Quarantined within the orbit of their
own moon, the human race must prove itself worthy to be accepted among their galactic
neighbors by restoring their own home world. Space stations now hang in tender balance
containing the civilians and military of the once habitable planet. 

Other alien species, anxious to see mankind fail, smuggle and sell outworld weapons 
technology, playing different human factions against one another in an effort to promote
conflict. This chapter of our story takes place aboard a group of stations in orbit 
above Egypt known as NeoCairo.
