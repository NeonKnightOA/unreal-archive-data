It’s the distant future and mankind has expanded beyond its solar system. After spending several centuries traveling, expanding and
populating, humans perfected the use of wormhole technology. But wormhole technology comes with a price: it consumes a natural resource
found only in particular systems. Many more decades passed as humans built and placed the wormhole devices at strategic points in their
little section of the galaxy, thus creating a network of “jump points.”

During this time, Mankind had been aware of a war that spanned the galaxy, though known only by the effects their technology left behind.
Through research and investigation, humans had learned that there was a massive war taking place between two powerful races: the benevolent
Aeryopolis (silvery bird-like creatures that are described as looking like mercury), and the ruthless Kreen (bizarre looking creatures
thought to have once had the ability to change their appearance at will. There is no current record of what they look like now, since they
dwell on space vessels only.) There are conflicting stories about the Kreen’s origin, as well as the cause and length of the war. The
general consensus is that the Kreen instigated the war.

Along the way, Man discovered new worlds and new races. The good majorities were benevolent, and some even opened trade routes. Wormhole
deployment was an ongoing project, ever-expanding their territory as they searched the great void known as the Milky Way Galaxy.

This is the story of one such deployment…
